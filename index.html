                    <p>Mommy, I’m-...
                        Stranded. With a chest full of
                        Urgency. Wasted.
                        No boat could sail for me now.
                        But the incessant need to see you,
                        Be with you, cry with you,
                        Was a trying companion to a breaking heart.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mommy,
                        You don’t deserve to leave life alone.
                        You don’t deserve to return to your Father,
                        With two empty hands and a heavy heart.
                        But you sound stronger today.
                        Hopeful, and my heart took on that strength.
                        Mommy I-...
                        I felt it when you left before the phone rang.
                        I felt the shallow void run deep
                        As toned, sorrowful condolences showed you lifeless on the bed.</p>

                    <p> You, another bag in luggage reclaim.
                        Me, another failure.
                        Another drop of loss in the pit of plagued bodies.<p>

                        Home. With a chest full of
                        Guilt. I deserved it.
                        No boat could sail for me now.</p>

                    <p>Since I didn't know what to write, the posts together are a poem I
                        I wrote for a Creative Writing course I did in second semester of my first
                        year. Don't even know if this will actually get read but if yeah, hope you like it.
                        Kinda sad I know, but its the reality some people face going through this whole pandemic
                        that has literally just turned peoples lives over...enough sad stuff. Have a good day!
